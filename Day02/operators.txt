Operators in JavaScript are symbols or keywords that allow you to perform various operations on values and variables. They can be categorized into several types based on their functionality:

**1. Arithmetic Operators:**
   - Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations on numeric values.
   - Common arithmetic operators include `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), and `%` (modulo).

   ```javascript
   let a = 10;
   let b = 5;
   let sum = a + b; // sum is 15
   let difference = a - b; // difference is 5
   let product = a * b; // product is 50
   let quotient = a / b; // quotient is 2
   let remainder = a % b; // remainder is 0
   ```

**2. Assignment Operators:**
   - Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
   - Common assignment operators include `=` (assign), `+=` (add and assign), `-=` (subtract and assign), `*=` (multiply and assign), and `/=` (divide and assign).

   ```javascript
   let x = 10;
   x += 5; // equivalent to x = x + 5; (x is now 15)
   ```

**3. Comparison Operators:**
   - Comparison operators are used to compare values and return a Boolean result (true or false).
   - Common comparison operators include `==` (equal), `!=` (not equal), `===` (strict equal), `!==` (strict not equal), `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), and `<=` (less than or equal to).

   ```javascript
   let num1 = 5;
   let num2 = "5";

   console.log(num1 == num2);  // true (equality with type coercion)
   console.log(num1 === num2); // false (strict equality)
   ```

**4. Logical Operators:**
   - Logical operators perform logical operations and return Boolean values.
   - Common logical operators include `&&` (logical AND), `||` (logical OR), and `!` (logical NOT).

   ```javascript
   let isTrue = true;
   let isFalse = false;

   console.log(isTrue && isFalse); // false
   console.log(isTrue || isFalse); // true
   console.log(!isTrue); // false
   ```

**5. Conditional (Ternary) Operator:**
   - The ternary operator `condition ? expr1 : expr2` is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement. It returns `expr1` if `condition` is true, otherwise `expr2`.

   ```javascript
   let age = 20;
   let isAdult = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";
   ```

**6. Typeof Operator:**
   - The `typeof` operator is used to determine the data type of a value or variable.
   - It returns a string indicating the data type, such as "number," "string," "boolean," "object," "undefined," "function," etc.

   ```javascript
   let num = 42;
   let text = "Hello";
   console.log(typeof num); // "number"
   console.log(typeof text); // "string"
   ```

**7. Bitwise Operators (Advanced):**
   - Bitwise operators manipulate the individual bits of numeric values.
   - Common bitwise operators include `&` (bitwise AND), `|` (bitwise OR), `^` (bitwise XOR), `~` (bitwise NOT), `<<` (left shift), and `>>` (right shift).

   ```javascript
   let a = 5; // binary: 0101
   let b = 3; // binary: 0011
   let result = a & b; // result is 1 (binary: 0001)
   ```

**8. Unary Operators:**
   - Unary operators operate on a single operand.
   - Common unary operators include `+` (unary plus, which doesn't change the value), `-` (unary minus, which negates the value), and `++` (increment) and `--` (decrement) for numeric values.

   ```javascript
   let number = 5;
   let negated = -number; // negated is -5
   number++; // number is now 6
   ```

Operators are an integral part of JavaScript and are used extensively in expressions and statements to perform a wide range of tasks, from simple arithmetic calculations to complex logical operations. Understanding the types and usage of operators is crucial for effective JavaScript programming.
